# RPN-Calculator

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) also called post-fixed notation, is a mathematic notation of arithmetic expressions 
where operands (numbers) are written before the operators (+, -, *, /) while avoiding the use of parentheses. 
The RPN is primarily adapted to a technical computer / electronic use, and has the characteristic of avoiding the use of parentheses.
